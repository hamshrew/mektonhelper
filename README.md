# MektonHelper
An old C++ program to aid in creating Mekton Zeta mektons for tabletop.

# Project History
I created this many years ago with a few major goals in mind:

* Create a program that could help create Mektons!
* Learn how to use Qt
* Learn how to use Mercurial
* Learn how to use Fogbugz

The last two points are no longer valid, since I use Git these days. But as a result of the second, a lot of this code is extremely inefficient and amateurish compared to what I'd write today. Still, perhaps it can be of some use to people.

# Current State

This was written for, I believe, Qt 5.0, and I have no idea if it will compile or run under modern systems. I may update it as time goes on, but for the moment this code is for other people to use.

# A note on descriptions

I purposely did not include descriptions of any of the actual systems, as this would remove most of the need to purchase the Mekton Zeta Technical Manual, and I certainly didn't want to deprive R. Talsorian of sales!

# A note on Trademarks

Mekton, Mekton Zeta, and related items are trademarks of R. Talsorian Games! I am NOT affiliated with R. Talsorian!
