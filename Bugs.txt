OUTSTANDING BUGS
----------------

* Not all locations update properly when a Servo name is changed.
* It is possible to add hands to a held location, or multiple hands to an arm, and have the hands count for purposes of held items.
* It is possible to add hands to a Weapon Mount.
* Wheel kills and propulsion spaces don't always update properly(though they are stored, just not displayed)
* Any table with a location delegate has a tiny memory leak when loading files. This is fixable, I just haven't done it yet.
